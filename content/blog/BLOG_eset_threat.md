A new and particularly dangerous technique, called ClickFix, is at the center of ESET’s latest Threat Report for the first half of 2025. Its activity increased by 500%, now ranking second among the most widespread cyberattack vectors, second only to phishing. ClickFix operates in a deceptive way, displaying fake errors that prompt victims to execute malicious commands on their devices. Alarmingly, it targets all major operating systems — Windows, Linux, and macOS — and is used to spread ransomware, infostealers, trojans, and even state-sponsored malware.

At the same time, research data shows a rise in SnakeStealer as the most widespread infostealer, displacing Agent Tesla. The activity of Lumma Stealer and Danabot also increased by 21% and 52%, respectively, before successful intervention by authorities.

In the Android space, the Kaleidoscope threat caused a 160% increase in adware detections, while NFC-based attacks surged, with techniques like GhostTap and SuperCard X directly targeting digital wallets.

ESET warns that cyber threats are evolving rapidly, adopting smarter, more targeted, and more aggressive tactics than ever before, and urges both users and businesses to remain constantly vigilant to deal with potential risks they may face.
