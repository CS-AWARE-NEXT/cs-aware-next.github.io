In a world where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and
interconnected, collaboration between organisations and regions is essential.
That’s where CS-CONNECT comes in.

Developed as part of the CS-AWARE NEXT project and funded by the European
Union’s Horizon Europe programme, CS-CONNECT is an innovative platform. Its
main goal is to support local and regional cybersecurity collaboration by offering a
dynamic environment in which organisations can share and review information, co-
create security policies and respond quickly to cybersecurity incidents.

CS-CONNECT has been designed from the ground up to help organisations and public
entities understand their cyber interdependencies and develop socio-technical solutions
collaboratively. Whether discussing threat intelligence, coordinating incident
responses or managing cybersecurity knowledge, CS-CONNECT provides the tools to
facilitate meaningful and actionable collaboration and interaction.

Emerging from a careful analysis of existing collaborative platforms, CS-CONNECT
was designed to be open, extensible and focused on data-driven discussions. Following
pilots in regions such as Foggia (Italy) and Larissa (Greece), the aim is to develop a
scalable solution for use by companies, municipalities, regional governments and other
stakeholders across Europe and beyond.

Ultimately, CS-CONNECT aims to transform fragmented cybersecurity efforts into a
unified, cooperative, and resilient defence system at local and regional levels.
