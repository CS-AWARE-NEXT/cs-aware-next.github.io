As Greece continues to digitize its public and private sectors, cybersecurity has become a national priority. Recent high-profile cyberattacks on government services and critical infrastructure have underscored the country's vulnerability to emerging digital threats. With growing investment in AI, cloud technologies, and smart city initiatives, Greece faces the same global challenges—AI-enabled attacks, cloud misconfigurations etc—but often with fewer resources and cybersecurity professionals compared to larger nations. In this evolving threat landscape, staying ahead requires not only adopting global best practices but also preparing for the specific vulnerabilities that come with Greece’s digital transformation. Added to the aforementioned, is the challenge of the lack of digital literacy, which makes the progress in this field even slower.

As organizations adopt emerging technologies, the cybersecurity landscape will be reshaped by AI-driven attacks, quantum risks, and vulnerabilities in cloud infrastructure. Check Point Software’s 2025 global cybersecurity predictions highlight key trends:

- **AI-powered attacks will surge:** Cybercriminals will leverage AI to craft highly personalized phishing campaigns and deploy malware that adapts in real time to bypass defenses. Even small-scale hackers will be able to execute large, sophisticated attacks, making cybercrime more accessible.

- **Ransomware will target supply chains:** Expect more precise, automated, and far-reaching ransomware operations that can paralyze entire sectors. Attackers will combine AI-generated phishing and deepfake impersonation techniques to breach systems.

- **Improper AI use will trigger data breaches:** As tools like ChatGPT become embedded in daily business processes, the risk of unintentional data exposure will rise. Companies must implement governance frameworks to ensure responsible AI use and safeguard sensitive information.

- **Quantum computing will challenge encryption standards:** While widespread quantum attacks remain a few years off, critical sectors such as finance and healthcare must start transitioning to quantum-resistant encryption methods now.

- **Social media and deepfakes will pose growing threats:** Malicious actors will exploit personal data and social platforms to execute targeted scams. Deepfake technology will endanger business communications and require advanced, real-time AI-driven security measures.

- **AI will revolutionize security operations:** Security Operations Centers (SOCs) will integrate AI co-pilots to handle massive data sets, identify high-priority threats, and accelerate response times.

- **CIOs and CISOs will converge:** With the increasing use of AI and hybrid cloud infrastructure, CIOs will take a more prominent role in cybersecurity, uniting IT and security responsibilities.

- **Cloud-native security will take center stage:** Enterprises will adopt Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs) and leverage AI for automated, proactive threat prevention.

- **IoT proliferation will expand the attack surface:** With an estimated 32 billion IoT devices in use by 2025, cybercriminals will exploit weakly secured endpoints to breach cloud ecosystems. Zero Trust architectures and AI-based threat detection will become essential defenses.

As businesses embrace new technologies, AI-driven attacks, quantum threats, and cloud security gaps will redefine the threat landscape.
