While many things in Cybersecurity may seem self-evident (need for good passwords, increased vigilance when handling emails, etc.), the site https:// Theconversation.com/ featured an interesting article on unintended effects of certain types of communication. In particular, it underscored the need to understand not just the technical needs of your audience but also the socio-economic aspects of the audience.

When conducting cybersecurity campaigns, we find that efforts at communication sometimes backfire and cause the opposite of the desired effect. Several consequences can arise:

1. Increased Resistance: People may become more resistant to the behavior being promoted. For example, strongly worded campaigns to encourage people to adopt healthy can make individuals less likely to adopt healthy behaviors1.

2. Reinforcement of Negative Behaviors: Highlighting the prevalence of a negative behavior can inadvertently normalize it, leading to an increase in that behavior. For instance, emphasizing how common weak password is can result in more weak passwords being used.

3. Damage to Credibility: The credibility of the source can be undermined if the message is perceived as manipulative or coercive. We have found this tends to make future communication less effective.

4. Polarization: Messages that threaten individual autonomy or identity can cause further divisions, especially on contentious issues like monitoring for contentious issues like climate change or political beliefs.

5. Emotional Reactance: People may experience a certain reactance where they feel their freedom is being restricted, leading them to do the opposite of what is being suggested (particularly an issue with evaluating possible phishing mail).

Understanding these consequences can certainly help in creating messages that are more likely to be received positively. The article outlined some strategies to avoid these pitfalls in communication.


One example of messages that can easily misfire is:

Fear Dominant Messages: Messages that use fear-based tactics to promote good cybersecurity habits can sometimes lead to denial or apathy instead of action.

How the way a message is framed can significantly impact its effectiveness. Avoiding messages that trigger the opposite of their desired effect involves careful planning and consideration. The article suggests some strategies:

1. Understand Your Audience: Tailor your message to the values, beliefs, and needs of your audience. Do your research or use feedback to understand their perspectives. Just because an action is a good idea (or even mandated by your organisation) is not enough for some people.

2. Clear and Positive Communication: Use clear, positive language. Avoid negative framing or scare tactics, which can lead to resistance or fear.

3. Empathy and Respect: Show empathy and respect for your audience’s feelings and experiences. Doing so can help build trust and make your message more relevant. At many of our presentations of the CS-AWARE project the audience is interested but have little background concerning cybersecurity.

4. Test and Revise: Before rolling out a message widely, test it with a small group. Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. Often said but not always practiced. It’s not much different from checking a program – testing is always a good idea.

5. Avoid Overgeneralization: Be specific and avoid making broad statements that might not apply to everyone. This helps in making the message more personal and relevant.

6. Consistency: Ensure your message is consistent across different platforms and communications. Mixed messaging can confuse and frustrate your intended audience.

7. Highlight Benefits: Focus on the positive outcomes and benefits of the desired behavior or action. People are more likely to respond positively to messages that highlight what they gain. Very often we find that politicians want to know what’s in it for them.

The article also lists some common pitfalls to avoid that can help ensure your message is effective and well-received. In our communication and dissemination activities we try to watch out for these pitfalls:

1. Poor Planning: Without a clear plan, your message can become disorganized and confusing. Take the time to outline your key points and the best way to present them. If possible, we find that it helps to follow a clear outline and speak directly to the audience.

2. Lack of Communication: Failing to communicate effectively can lead to misunderstandings. Ensure your message is clear, concise, and tailored to your audience. In other words, try not to use too much technical jargon. Using stories based on the audience’s experience tends to be more effective than an explanation of malware.

3. Inadequate Resources: Not having the necessary resources can hinder your ability to deliver your message effectively. Make sure you have everything you need before you start. It seems simple enough but it’s hard to communicate with an audience when you find that you don’t have everything for your presentation.

4. Unforeseen Obstacles: Be prepared for potential challenges that may arise. Having a proactive attitude can help you navigate these obstacles more smoothly. At times computers might not work or the Internet is not accessible.

5. Defaulting to Consensus: While seeking consensus can be beneficial, it can also lead to less creative problem-solving particularly with a topic like cybersecurity that is relatively new to many.

6. Misunderstanding the Audience: Not understanding your audience’s values, beliefs, and needs can result in a message that doesn’t resonate. Doing the research and encouraging feedback before proceeding to more technical aspects is always appreciated..


In general, the closing examples in the article of unfortunate campaigns gone off course all have similar instances in our work with dissemination of the results of the project.

The first one involved health campaigns use strongly worded messages that end up backfiring. For example, strongly worded messages promoting dental flossing made people angry and more likely to resist flossing their teeth. Coercive alcohol prevention messages, with language like “any reasonable person must acknowledge these conclusions,” instead increased alcohol consumption. In contrast, the wording of the title “Everybody’s Free (to Wear Sunscreen)” is less likely to backfire by emphasizing liberty of choice.
