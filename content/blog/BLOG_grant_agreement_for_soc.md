A Grant Agreement for the Security Operations Center (SOC) for the enhancement of cyber security in Greece.

A Grant Agreement has been signed between the ministry of digital governance and the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre (ECCC) who will fund the development and operation of the “SOC–Security Operations Center”.

The Grant Agreement is in the frame of the funding programme “DEP” and the budget of the project reaches 9.7 million euros, out of which 50% is a European funding and the other 50% will be covered by national resources.

The development of SOC will be carried out with the co-operation of the National Institution for Cyber Security of the Ministry of Digital Governance and a number of private companies and institutions that specialize in this field.

SOC will offer an infrastructure of strategic importance, as well as know-how for attack prevention in cyber space. At the same time it will provide for free the necessary services to ensure the interconnected digital systems of public and private organisations.

In this way, Greece, by taking part parallelly in a shared group with other countries-members of the EE (Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria) for the development of the respective cross -border infrastructure, is a front runner in the materialization of the “European Cyber-security Shield” and arms the Greek cyber space and the Greek critical infrastructures against current threats.

SOC, among others, aims at developing, empowering and supporting proficiency on a national level, for the timely tracking and dealing with cyber attacks in the Greek territory, predominantly by strengthening the features of in-time warning, tracking and treatment of cyber-attacks with the use of artificial intelligence tools and artificial learning. It will be a focal point of report on a national level.

“Grant Agreement set the foundations for the materialization of an emblematic project for the improvement of cyber-security in our country. SOC will majorly contribute to Greece’s stronger digital transition, to cyber-resilience of critical public and private organisations and of course to a safe daily use of the internet by the citizens”, said the minister of Digital Governance.
