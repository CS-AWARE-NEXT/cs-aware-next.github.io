Even if you’re not a fan of true crime documentaries or podcasts, you’re probably familiar with some of the well-known serial killers from USA in the 1980s. Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Golden State Killer to name a few. 

Now what does this have to do with cybersecurity and CS-AWARE-NEXT? I promise there is a connection other than justifying my consumption of true crime podcasts during office hours! 

Watching true crime documentaries, where the serial killer is caught much too late because they committed their crimes in different states or counties and the police stations didn’t share information across borders. In their defence, at the time, the technology wasn’t developed to do so. 

Looking back, it’s frustrating to know that lives could have been saved if only the technology and knowledge was as good back then as it is today. They had to start somewhere, they learned to share information across borders in order to save lives! 

Now, what does serial killers have to do with improving cybersecurity? 

Much like the police stations who didn’t share information and experience about a possible serial killer on the loose with other police stations, the same thing could be happening in organisations regarding cyberattacks or weaknesses in security systems. 

Maybe the right information is already discovered in one organisation, but not in another one and a severe cyberattack on critical infrastructures or hospitals happen because of it? This brings us back to the frustrating feeling about the slow catching of serial killers. Imagine that frustration many years into the future when it’s common practise for cybersecurity to share experience and wondering why we didn’t already do this back in 2024.  


Now we just need to get there. This is where CS-AWARE-NEXT comes in!
