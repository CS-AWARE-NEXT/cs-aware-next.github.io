Cyberattacks often seem to come out of nowhere, but behind the scenes, teams of cybersecurity experts are constantly scanning for warning signs. Through a process known as threat forecasting, analysts look at patterns in data, emerging technologies, hacker conversations, and even geopolitical shifts to predict what types of cyberattacks might happen next. It’s not magic, it’s cyberthreat intelligence.

Much like weather forecasting, predicting cyber threats relies on spotting trends early. If hackers begin experimenting with new tactics or tools, those clues often surface first in obscure corners of the internet, like dark web forums or malware code repositories. Cybersecurity analysts collect and analyse this data to identify new techniques before they become widespread, giving companies and users a head start in defending themselves.

One recent example is the rise of deepfake scams. A few years ago, they were just a novelty, but cyberthreat analysts noticed early testing of voice-cloning and video manipulation tools in underground hacker groups. That insight helped security teams develop countermeasures before these techniques were used in high-stakes fraud and impersonation attacks. The same goes for ransomware, phishing trends, and even attacks targeting smart devices or AI systems.

For the average person, these predictions translate into safer apps, quicker software updates, and alerts about new scams before they reach your inbox. The more we can anticipate what’s coming, the more we can prevent and not just respond to cyberattacks. While no one can see the future perfectly, cyberthreat intelligence gives us our best shot at staying a step ahead in an increasingly digital world.
