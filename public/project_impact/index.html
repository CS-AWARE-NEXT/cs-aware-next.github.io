            <section>

                <p>The main vehicle for exploitation of the CS-AWARE-NEXT project results (and thus the project’s pathways to impact) is the <a href="https://cs-aware.com/">CS-AWARE Corporation</a>, which intends to bring the project results to the market in the context of the CS-AWARE cybersecurity awareness and management platform. For further dissemination of project results, academic partners have interest in creating educational and research impact, while SMEs and industry partners have interest in advancing technological achievements and advancing the market introduction of project results.</p>
<p>CS-AWARE caters to two target markets: The NIS (Network and Information Security) sector market and the LPA (Local Public Administration) market. We have identified over one million European companies operating in the critical and important sectors defined by the NIS/NIS2 directive. According to Eurostat, there are around 96.000 European LPAs. This equals a serviceable available market (SAM) of around 1,1 million organizations, building the baseline for our assumptions of scale for the outcome/impact of each individual contribution below.</p>
<p>Regarding the significance, it is exceptionally hard to derive a baseline assumption for quantifying improvements in the context of cybersecurity R&amp;I. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies available that would enable one to quantify specific aspects of cybersecurity, or the collaborative European cybersecurity framework. A recent ENISA study on NIS investments provides some interesting quantified insights into the state of NIS implementation in relevant European companies, but does not provide the means to derive a baseline against which the significance of CS-AWARE-NEXT contributions could be quantified, other than the statement that “82% of surveyed organisations acknowledge a positive impact of the NIS Directive on their security program”. Furthermore, the annual Accenture cost of cybercrime report provides interesting insights on potential cost savings (especially highlighting the potential in the context of threat intelligence, AI and user behaviour analytics), but this does not provide a relevant benchmark basis for improvements introduced by CS-AWARE-NEXT either. While CS-AWARE-NEXT is addressing the issue of the paucity of quantifiable data relating to cybersecurity by proposing a dynamic profiling and benchmarking framework (Objective 6) that is applicable to the fast-changing cybersecurity environment, we cannot rely on this framework yet to provide a sensible quantification of significance. We therefore derive our significance estimates from the perspective of an informed and expert judgement, based on the work and the validation results of the CS-AWARE project. This enables us to postulate an informed, and we believe, realistic estimate of improvement potential.</p>
<h3 id="unique-contribution-1-improved-organisational-policy-support-for-dynamic-cybersecurity-management">Unique contribution 1: Improved organisational policy support for dynamic cybersecurity management</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A cybersecurity policy management framework for organizations that is able to deal with the dynamic and fast-changing cybersecurity requirements, and integrates with the cooperative/collaborative efforts of the European collaborative cybersecurity framework. It has the potential for significantly improving the cybersecurity of organizations (including intra-departmental and supply chain considerations) and to significantly reduce the success and impact of cyberattacks on organizations and their supply chains. It does this by enabling the operationalisation of tasks related to cybersecurity risk and incident management in an effective and efficient way (e.g. self-healing, disaster recovery, business continuity, preparedness, information sharing, collaboration, &hellip;), contributing to the listed impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Target group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small, medium and large-sized (NIS sector/public) organizations</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mid-term impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced self-healing disaster recovery and effective business continuity in critical sectors (e.g. energy, transportation, health)</li>
<li>Enhanced mechanisms for exchange of information among relevant players</li>
<li>Better disaster preparedness against possible disruptions, attacks and cascading effects</li>
<li>Better business continuity covering two or more sectors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-term impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthened EU cybersecurity capacities and European Union sovereignty in digital technologies</li>
<li>More resilient digital infrastructures, systems and processes</li>
<li>Increased software, hardware and supply chain security</li>
<li>Secured disruptive technologies</li>
<li>Reinforced awareness and a common cyber security management and culture</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Type of outcome/impact (scientific, economic/technological, societal):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific: The cybersecurity policy framework - academic dissemination and standardization potential.</li>
<li>Economic/technological: A reference implementation of the policy framework (CS-AWARE platform).</li>
<li>Societal: The societal impact of the cybersecurity policy management framework is expected to be an increase in cybersecurity in general through the widespread use by individual organizations, and the concomitant broadening and deepening of the understanding of cybersecurity issues by those who work in those organisations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scale and significance of project’s contributions, including quantified estimates</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> 10% reach in the target market (110.000 organizations) in 10 years through CS-AWARE platform</p>
<p><strong>Significance:</strong>
Efficiency and effectiveness of cybersecurity management increased by 60% in target organizations</p>
<h3 id="unique-contribution-2-improved-cooperationcollaboration-on-the-localregional-level-and-its-inclusion-in-the-multi-level-european-collaborative-cybersecurity-framework">Unique contribution 2: Improved cooperation/collaboration on the local/regional level and its inclusion in the multi-level European collaborative cybersecurity framework</h3>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Improved strategic and coordinated cooperation/collaboration on the local/regional level is currently missing in the multi-level European cybersecurity efforts, and has the potential for significant outcomes and impacts in this context (including the ability to better address cascading supply chain issues). It contributes to all expected outcomes listed in the call topic, and most of the impacts listed in the work programme destination by providing an environment for collaborating on cybersecurity issues that go beyond organizational boundaries.</p>
<p><strong>Target group:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small, medium and large-sized (NIS sector/public) organizations</li>
<li>Industry associations/LPAs for managing local/regional collaboration</li>
<li>Competent authorities/CSIRTs for link to multilevel cybersecurity collaboration</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mid-term impact:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Advanced self-healing disaster recovery and effective business continuity in critical sectors (e.g. energy, transportation, health)</li>
<li>Enhanced mechanisms for exchange of information among relevant players</li>
<li>Better disaster preparedness against possible disruptions, attacks and cascading effects</li>
<li>Better business continuity covering two or more sectors</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Long-term impact:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Description:</strong> Benchmarking and profiling in the context of cybersecurity management is traditionally highly individual and depends on the organizational context. There is currently no benchmarking and profiling approach available that allows to assess an organization against the baseline derived from other levels of the multi-level European cybersecurity framework, and the contribution has therefore a significant potential for outcomes and impacts in this context, providing organizations with quantifiable data of their security status and potential for improvement. This relates to the outcomes listed in the call topic concerning enhanced information sharing mechanisms and better preparedness. It relates on one way or another to all impacts listed in the work programme destination, including quantifiable security assurance.</p>
