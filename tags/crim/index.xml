This four days event has been held since 1999 and brings together teachers, researchers, experts, and students of cybersecurity: &lt;a href="https://www.oulu.fi/en/crim"&gt;https://www.oulu.fi/en/crim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CriM had twelve talks before lunch and three exercises in the afternoon, covering topics from incidence response to password handling. We were especially glad to hear a talk from Bart Preneel, Europe’s most pronounced cryptography expert, who reminded us at the end of his presentation to a quote from Immanuel Kant “Optimism is a moral duty”.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
