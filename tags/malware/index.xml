Its activity increased by 500%, now ranking second among the most widespread cyberattack vectors, second only to phishing. ClickFix operates in a deceptive way, displaying fake errors that prompt victims to execute malicious commands on their devices. Alarmingly, it targets all major operating systems — Windows, Linux, and macOS — and is used to spread ransomware, infostealers, trojans, and even state-sponsored malware.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity &amp; the Domino effect</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/27/blog_domino_effect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/27/blog_domino_effect/</guid><description>&lt;p>A cyberattack is rarely caused by one big thing, but more often a combination of many little things. We see it all the time in disaster documentary film, how even the tiniest little detail can start a chain reaction with devastating results. A chain reaction that could have been stopped if even just one of the Dominos in the line were missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take documentary film about plane crashes for example. We know flying is safe, we know how high the security priority is. In the events of a crash, we hear of all the frustratedly many small errors and we are left wondering how so many things have been overlooked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dangerous malware in Greece</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/blog_dangerous_software/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/blog_dangerous_software/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last report from Check Point Research, in August 2024, reveals the most recent data on the most prevalent cyberthreats in a global scale but also in Greece.
