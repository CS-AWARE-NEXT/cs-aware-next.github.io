Fuelled by national reforms and EU recovery funds, more and more municipalities are bringing services online. Yet as digital adoption accelerates, a critical vulnerability has emerged: cybersecurity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="a-more-digital-italyeven-at-the-local-level">A More Digital Italy—Even at the Local Level?&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Digital innovation is no longer the exclusive domain of central ministries or major cities. Local governments across Italy are embracing new technologies at an unprecedented pace. The data speaks for itself:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Greek companies have the weakest cybersecurity</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/05/30/blog_greek_companies/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 May 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/05/30/blog_greek_companies/</guid><description>&lt;p>Greek businesses have emerged as the weakest link in the European Union when it comes to cybersecurity, ranking last in terms of protective measures against cyberattacks. Just days after Kaspersky released data showing that Greece tops the list as the most dangerous online environment globally, Eurostat figures paint a grim picture of corporate cyber-readiness, placing Greek companies extremely low in the rankings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the latest Eurostat data, while the majority of companies in the EU have implemented cybersecurity measures, disparities among member-states remain significant. Greek companies stand out negatively, being labeled as the weakest of Europe in terms of implementing cybersecurity protections.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What can cybersecurity learn from true crime?</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/05/01/blog_cybersec_truecrime/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/05/01/blog_cybersec_truecrime/</guid><description>&lt;p>Even if you’re not a fan of true crime documentaries or podcasts, you’re probably familiar with some of the well-known serial killers from USA in the 1980s. Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and the Golden State Killer to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now what does this have to do with cybersecurity and CS-AWARE-NEXT? I promise there is a connection other than justifying my consumption of true crime podcasts during office hours!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watching true crime documentaries, where the serial killer is caught much too late because they committed their crimes in different states or counties and the police stations didn’t share information across borders. In their defence, at the time, the technology wasn’t developed to do so.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity &amp; the Domino effect</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/27/blog_domino_effect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/27/blog_domino_effect/</guid><description>&lt;p>A cyberattack is rarely caused by one big thing, but more often a combination of many little things. We see it all the time in disaster documentary film, how even the tiniest little detail can start a chain reaction with devastating results. A chain reaction that could have been stopped if even just one of the Dominos in the line were missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take documentary film about plane crashes for example. We know flying is safe, we know how high the security priority is. In the events of a crash, we hear of all the frustratedly many small errors and we are left wondering how so many things have been overlooked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Beyond 2025</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/15/blog_beyond/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Apr 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/15/blog_beyond/</guid><description>&lt;p>OTS Company, as a partner of the CS-AWARE-NEXT, represented the project at the international digital technology and innovation exhibition “Beyond”, which took place from 4 to 6 of April 2025 in Athens, Greece.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond fosters the development of innovative technologies and business opportunities, while it aims at creating a hub that promotes collaboration and encourages the exchange of knowledge and ideas. It is a great opportunity for global innovators, researchers, and start-ups to connect. This year, the title of the exhibition was “AI Reality Bites” and focused on artificial intelligence and all the factors that come along as it integrates society. Cybersecurity was also a key theme: there were experts who demonstrated live, discussed in panels and showcased in workshops the importance of it and how a user or an organization can be safer online.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity in Italian Municipalities: A Growing Emergency</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/03/31/blog_cybsec_italian_munc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/03/31/blog_cybsec_italian_munc/</guid><description>&lt;p>In recent years, the digitalization of Public Administration has increasingly exposed the
cybersecurity vulnerabilities of Italian municipalities. Hacker attacks are multiplying, targeting public
offices and essential services, while institutions struggle to respond with new regulations and
protective measures. However, the problems persist, and municipalities often find themselves
unprepared in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rising Concern Over Cybersecurity in Municipalities&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to data from the National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN), in 2024 about 18% of
cyberattacks targeted Public Administration, particularly affecting local authorities and healthcare
centers. This alarming trend prompted the government to respond with legislative measures and
security strategies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social engineering - the Jedi mind trick of cyberattacks.</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/03/03/blog_soc_eng/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/03/03/blog_soc_eng/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>“These aren’t the droids you’re looking for”, “These aren’t the droids we’re looking for”&lt;/em> - The iconic exchange between Ben (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and the Stormtroopers in Star Wars episode IV - A New Hope.

&lt;p>Cybersecurity in the public sector is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring the integrity of essential services, and maintaining public trust. Government agencies handle vast amounts of personal data and critical infrastructure, making them prime targets for cyberattacks. Effective cybersecurity measures prevent data breaches, protect national security, and ensure the continuity of public services. By investing in robust cybersecurity frameworks, the public sector can mitigate risks, respond effectively to incidents, and uphold the privacy and safety of citizens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The importance of user role definition and access restrictions</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_importance_of_role_definition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 17:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_importance_of_role_definition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many of us have seen the cinematic masterpiece called The Lord of the Rings and can recall the scene where Pippin Took touches The Palantír (the glass orb looking thing with the eye of Sauron in it) and thus gave said villain an insight to his mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bad news: Sauron knows everything Pippin knows.
The good news: Pippin doesn’t know anything!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first there is the panic when Gandalf thinks Sauron now knows everything, then there is the calmness of realising the ‘fool of a Took&amp;rsquo; knows nothing that Sauron can use. If we compare that to real life: The panic of knowing your systems have been infiltrated, then the calmness of realising that the access is very limited and doesn’t cover any of the important parts of the IT system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Cybersecurity Master's Program in Oulu</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/09/01/blog_new_cybersec_curri/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/09/01/blog_new_cybersec_curri/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cybersecurity is a new study option based on the research excellence in software security at the University of Oulu.

&lt;p>As presented in the final expert report, ‘the whole HSBooster consultancy process with CS-AWARE NEXT went fluently and there was great support by the team of CS-AWARE NEXT to identify a suitable standardisation strategy for their envisioned project results’. It is also mentioned that ‘the CS-AWARE NEXT project is on a very good track’ and that we ‘have identified a clear and actionable target’ in terms of, amongst others, ‘adding an extension to the OASIS STIX public repository’. There is no doubt that this might potentially ‘pave the way for future standardisation impacts, i.e., the inclusion of the extension in the official STIX OASIS standard’.
Standardisation is, as known to all of us that have been involved in one or some other way in such a process, a long shot, but also well worth trying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhancing your security with open-source tools</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/08/29/blog_enhancing_security_open_source/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/08/29/blog_enhancing_security_open_source/</guid><description>&lt;p>With cybersecurity gaining increased attention in Italy, it has emerged as the top priority for digital investment among businesses in 2023. Notably, both large enterprises and SMEs recognize the significance of robust cybersecurity measures. Recent data reveals that a staggering 61% of organisations with over 250 employees have chosen to boost their cybersecurity budgets in the past year. Moreover, the Italian cybersecurity market is projected to witness remarkable growth, reaching a value of 1.86 billion euros in 2022, reflecting an exceptional acceleration of +18% compared to the previous year. In this article, we delve into the realm of monitoring and analysis, exploring the potential of open-source solutions to strengthen cybersecurity defences and address the evolving challenges faced by Italian organisations.

On a technical level there already is an elevated level of awareness and readiness. That is why in a first wave of attacks criminals usually focus on tricking users into opening up systems for them . While this has now been the rule for at least over a decade, the way in which these attacks are prepared now follow an almost military style approach. With new, highly distributed environments, little protected IoT systems, tools based on AI, and the weakest link in the chain, the human, not being able to invest the needed time and resources in cyber security, the rise in successful cyber-attacks is predictable . While the need for education and training is commonly accepted, the necessary significant shift in countering cyber-attacks from a purely operational to a tactical and strategic level is still an open issue in many organizations. Policy-based reactions to cyber-attacks should have long ago replaced the still prevailing bug-fixing approach to dealing with an intrusion. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Learning from military and business decision making, such long overdue model-based solutions are also finding their way into the field of cyber security. The first highly successful wave of these decision models is shaped by the now legendary OODA Loop , which properly links observations (e.g., OSINT cyber threat intelligence, system monitoring) with an advanced form of classification (called orientation). These two steps, when combined properly, can provide the critical situational awareness needed to make the right decision, on which the actions taken depend. Especially in distributed collaborative environments, which typically characterize the ecosystem of projects like CS-AWARE-NEXT , these models are a welcome game changer. When applied together with well-established cyber defence frameworks such as NIST/CSF , there is an opportunity to thwart even advanced AI-based attacks. Attacks are on the rise and their sophistication is growing, but better situational awareness, advanced military grade decision models and proven cybersecurity frameworks, when applied in an integrated way can equip Security Operations Centres with the necessary tools to successfully shelter the expected oncoming heavy attack storms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data poisoning attacks</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/25/cs_aware_next_data_poisoning/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/25/cs_aware_next_data_poisoning/</guid><description>&lt;p>Data poisoning is an increasingly important security concern for Machine Learning (ML) systems. As machine learning models are becoming more prevalent in our lives, they are also becoming more vulnerable to malicious attacks. Data poisoning attacks are one of the most insidious and difficult-to-detect kinds of threats on ML models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data poisoning is a type of adversarial attack in which a cybercriminal injects malicious data into a machine learning model. These attacks can be used to manipulate the results of a machine learning system, or to redirect the system&amp;rsquo;s resources away from its intended purpose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Massive increase in cyber attacks in 2022</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/24/cs_aware_next_massive-cyber/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/24/cs_aware_next_massive-cyber/</guid><description>&lt;p>Universities, research centers, state and military services, hospitals, communication infrastructure and banks have received numerous cyberattacks in 2022; and the worst is yet to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is estimated that more than 1.000 cyberattacks per organisation take place throughout the universe, which is 38% more than 2021. In Europe in particular, the average number of attacks per target reached 1.000, with an increase of 26% when compared to 2021. In a worse position one can find the Americans, as they faced an increase of 52%!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CriM -- Cyber Security Seminar and Workshops -- 2022</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/19/cs_aware_next_crim/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/19/cs_aware_next_crim/</guid><description>&lt;p>During November 2022 we held the Cyber Security Seminar and Workshops in Oulu, Finland.

As Miller [1], points out, local governments could benefit from the information that would lead to the early prevention of cyberattacks. Unfortunately, the information is often hidden or never revealed. Although municipalities are obliged to report attacks in a timely fashion, they often avoid reporting attacks to maintain credibility. Nor do they necessarily see sharing of information about attacks as useful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions II</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/11/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/11/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cyberattacks launched on municipal utility companies are similar to attacks in any other industry. However, the potential for OT attacks and the dangers of a major service disruption has raised the stakes. Miller outlines in this article [1] the most common cybersecurity attacks that have affected municipal utility companies. &lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="denial-of-service">Denial of Service &lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Attacks that stop users from accessing essential networks are typically referred to as denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A DoS attack is initiated by a single attacking computer. A DDoS attack is launched by multiple attacking devices. While the attack is in progress, companies can&amp;rsquo;t access the means to provide services. These attacks have serious implications for any company, but the interruption of essential services like electricity or running water can quickly become disastrous.  Unfortunately, given the lack of training many utilities are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks. While these attacks are difficult to deal with, more work on raising an awareness of the issues and possible counter-measures would be invaluable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions I</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/02/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/02/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities1/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 2021 Jason Miller wrote an article on cybersecurity for municipal utilities stressing that cyber-attacks were increasing every year and greatly impacting a wide range of high-profile targets from governmental agencies to financial and insurance organizations, hospitals and other health facilities, and educational institutions. Of particular concern in many countries, he points out, is the situation on local levels where local governments with municipal utilities are often under-funded with poorly trained staff [1]. Unfortunately, the solutions he offers do not take into account the range of problems facing municipal utilities. Many are not aware, however, of how municipal utilities have become targets for “nation-state actors” and the possibly disastrous effects of an attack.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Startups in Europe – and elsewhere</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/11/27/cs_aware_next_startups_in_europe/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/11/27/cs_aware_next_startups_in_europe/</guid><description>&lt;p>CS-AWARE Corporation is not only one of the partners of the CS-AWARE-NEXT Consortium, but also the main vehicle for the exploitation of all project outcomes and results.
