They contained messages pretending to be from the recipient’s bank or a familiar company, designed to steal the victim’s login details. While phishing is still common, social engineering has evolved far beyond those emails. Contemporary scammers are using more sophisticated techniques, blending psychology with technology to manipulate people into giving up information, money, or access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest shifts is the rise of deepfakes, that is highly realistic fake videos, audio clips, or images generated by artificial intelligence. Cybercriminals now use AI-powered voice cloning to impersonate CEOs in phone calls, tricking employees into transferring funds. Others create fake video messages that look like they came from trusted colleagues or even family members. These scams prey on trust, making it harder for people to tell what’s real and what’s fake.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity &amp; the Domino effect</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/27/blog_domino_effect/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Apr 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/04/27/blog_domino_effect/</guid><description>&lt;p>A cyberattack is rarely caused by one big thing, but more often a combination of many little things. We see it all the time in disaster documentary film, how even the tiniest little detail can start a chain reaction with devastating results. A chain reaction that could have been stopped if even just one of the Dominos in the line were missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take documentary film about plane crashes for example. We know flying is safe, we know how high the security priority is. In the events of a crash, we hear of all the frustratedly many small errors and we are left wondering how so many things have been overlooked.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
