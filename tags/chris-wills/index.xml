The reason we shall experiment with podcasts in national languages, namely not in English is rather simple: English can be our common working language for Deliverables, and can be ideal for reaching out researchers, but if we truly want to walk the last mile and increase the visibility of the project to a large audience in the participating countries, then the best is to create content in the different national languages.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 questions – 3 answers: The first CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_1/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are happy to announce the first CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast with Chris Wills!&lt;/p>
