cybersecurity vulnerabilities of Italian municipalities. Hacker attacks are multiplying, targeting public
offices and essential services, while institutions struggle to respond with new regulations and
protective measures. However, the problems persist, and municipalities often find themselves
unprepared in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rising Concern Over Cybersecurity in Municipalities&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to data from the National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN), in 2024 about 18% of
cyberattacks targeted Public Administration, particularly affecting local authorities and healthcare
centers. This alarming trend prompted the government to respond with legislative measures and
security strategies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New investigation by Kaspersky on Cyber Attacks</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_cyberattacks_kaspersky/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_cyberattacks_kaspersky/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kaspersky has recently concluded an &lt;a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_kaspersky-reports-attacks-on-industrial-sector-utilizing-cloud-infrastructure">investigation&lt;/a> into cyber-attacks targeting the industrial sector in Eastern Europe. The investigation has revealed the employment of advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by threat actors to compromise industrial organizations in the region. Industries such as manufacturing, industrial control system (ICS) engineering and integration have been particularly affected, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity preparedness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the research a series of targeted attacks was revealed, aiming at data -breach through the creation of a channel with similarities to cases previously reported, such as ExCone, and DexCone, a fact that clearly manifests the participation of APT31 (also known as Judgement Panda and Zirconium).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyberattack in Thessaloniki</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_cyberattack_thessaloniki/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_cyberattack_thessaloniki/</guid><description>&lt;p>Five years ago the security of the digital infrastructures of the organisations was not even an object of discussion.

&lt;p>It comes without saying that file sharing policies, back-up check in portable devices, active directory, firewall, certified connection of the users in the internet, GDPR, website access restrictions and in everything that we today consider digital security.
All of the above though, change for the best in the past few years. The Covid era was a milestone in this process as the safe remote access to the information systems became a non-negotiable necessity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyberattack in Thessaloniki</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_data-driven_cybersecurity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_data-driven_cybersecurity/</guid><description>&lt;p>Five years ago the security of the digital infrastructures of the organisations was not even an object of discussion.
