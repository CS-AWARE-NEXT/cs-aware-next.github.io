&lt;p>Kaspersky has recently concluded an &lt;a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_kaspersky-reports-attacks-on-industrial-sector-utilizing-cloud-infrastructure">investigation&lt;/a> into cyber-attacks targeting the industrial sector in Eastern Europe. The investigation has revealed the employment of advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by threat actors to compromise industrial organizations in the region. Industries such as manufacturing, industrial control system (ICS) engineering and integration have been particularly affected, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity preparedness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the research a series of targeted attacks was revealed, aiming at data -breach through the creation of a channel with similarities to cases previously reported, such as ExCone, and DexCone, a fact that clearly manifests the participation of APT31 (also known as Judgement Panda and Zirconium).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyberattack in Thessaloniki</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_cyberattack_thessaloniki/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_cyberattack_thessaloniki/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cyberattack-in-thessaloniki">Cyberattack in Thessaloniki&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Five years ago the security of the digital infrastructures of the organisations was not even an object of discussion. Most though of security as a store room with a lock on the outside, a back-up external drive, that usually remained connected on the server, and an antivirus that in most of the cases was a free one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It comes without saying that file sharing policies, back-up check in portable devices, active directory, firewall, certified connection of the users in the internet, GDPR, website access restrictions and in everything that we today consider digital security.
All of the above though, change for the best in the past few years. The Covid era was a milestone in this process as the safe remote access to the information systems became a non-negotiable necessity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyberattack in Thessaloniki</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_data-driven_cybersecurity/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_data-driven_cybersecurity/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cyberattack-in-thessaloniki">Cyberattack in Thessaloniki&lt;/h2>
