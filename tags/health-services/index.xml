It is about the May 2021 ransomware attack on the Health Service Executive (HSE).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the year 2021, a &lt;a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/conti-cyber-attack-on-the-hse-full-report.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; was published, that had been commissioned by the Health Services Executive (“HSE”). The report counts about 100 pages – so it is not what one might regard as a convenient reading for an evening discussion. However, there are many generic cybersecurity issues that the report raises that are to be addressed in the CS-AWARE-NEXT project&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
