&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t remember if have heard of this incident before, but this could actually be a great base scenario for CS-AWARE-NEXT.
It is about the May 2021 ransomware attack on the Health Service Executive (HSE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the end of the year 2021, a &lt;a href="https://www.hse.ie/eng/services/publications/conti-cyber-attack-on-the-hse-full-report.pdf">report&lt;/a> was published, that had been commissioned by the Health Services Executive (“HSE”). The report counts about 100 pages – so it is not what one might regard as a convenient reading for an evening discussion. However, there are many generic cybersecurity issues that the report raises that are to be addressed in the CS-AWARE-NEXT project&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
