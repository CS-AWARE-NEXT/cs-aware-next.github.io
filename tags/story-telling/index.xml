Representatives of multiple public and private organisations came together for four days for these workshops that were organised by our project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the workshop, participants shared stories about their experiences with cybersecurity in their organisations, and, in addition, discussed real world examples of cyberattacks that had serious implications on a region, or, the term we like to use, on an entire ecosystem. An ecosystem is a group of organisations that live and interact together in a particular environment. Despite cybersecurity being ubiquitous, and attacks coming from anywhere, in an ecosystem, local organisations can have joint interests when it comes to cybersecurity.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
