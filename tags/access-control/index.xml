&lt;p&gt;The bad news: Sauron knows everything Pippin knows.
The good news: Pippin doesn’t know anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first there is the panic when Gandalf thinks Sauron now knows everything, then there is the calmness of realising the ‘fool of a Took&amp;rsquo; knows nothing that Sauron can use. If we compare that to real life: The panic of knowing your systems have been infiltrated, then the calmness of realising that the access is very limited and doesn’t cover any of the important parts of the IT system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
