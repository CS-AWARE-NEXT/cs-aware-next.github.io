The study attempts, for the first time in the Greek market, to thoroughly analyse the current national and European legal and regulatory framework of cybersecurity. European regulations, such as NIS, NIS II and CERD, the main legal acts on cybersecurity in Greece (4577/2018, 4961/2022), their field of practice and the next steps for the compliance of the Greek companies with those, are presented in the study. In addition, the study describes the goals and the respective actions of the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020-2025 that was presented by the Ministry of Digital Governance.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Users are not stupid</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_users-are-not-stupid/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_users-are-not-stupid/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This article from Julie Haney of NIST deals with some of the misconceptions and pitfalls that cyber security professionals fall victim to. These pitfalls reflect a tendency in the cyber security community “to focus and depend on technology to solve today’s security problems while at the same time failing to appreciate the human element: the individual and social factors affecting security adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To appreciate the importance of the human element in cyber security, Haney suggests it would be best to understand the concepts of usability and usable cyber security.
The International Organization for Standardization definition of usability is ‘the extent to which people can use systems, products, and services with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction to accomplish their goals in a specified context of use’.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Why old school thinking?</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_why-old-school-thinking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_why-old-school-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;For many years, a report from Govloop in the US writes, government agencies have applied a “hodgepodge of cyber-security strategies” to counter both internal and external risks. Many relied on firewalls to manage external activity and potential threats. In the end, the Govloop authors conclude that Legacy firewalls tend to be more concerned with activity attempting to penetrate their perimeter defenses and do not monitor internal activities within the local network.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
