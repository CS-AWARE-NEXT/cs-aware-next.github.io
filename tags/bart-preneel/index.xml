This four days event has been held since 1999 and brings together teachers, researchers, experts, and students of cybersecurity: https://www.oulu.fi/en/crim.
CriM had twelve talks before lunch and three exercises in the afternoon, covering topics from incidence response to password handling. We were especially glad to hear a talk from Bart Preneel, Europe’s most pronounced cryptography expert, who reminded us at the end of his presentation to a quote from Immanuel Kant “Optimism is a moral duty”.</description></item></channel></rss>
