More specifically, the anti-virus (AV) solutions are scanning the system’s storage devices and hash files at process/creation time. They then compare each of these hashes with their respective curated database which contains signatures of known malware samples. If there is a match then the file is flagged as malicious and subsequent actions take place to contain it.
