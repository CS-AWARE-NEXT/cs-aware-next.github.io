&lt;p>In recent years, the digitalization of Public Administration has increasingly exposed the
cybersecurity vulnerabilities of Italian municipalities. Hacker attacks are multiplying, targeting public
offices and essential services, while institutions struggle to respond with new regulations and
protective measures. However, the problems persist, and municipalities often find themselves
unprepared in the face of increasingly sophisticated threats.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Rising Concern Over Cybersecurity in Municipalities&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to data from the National Cybersecurity Agency (ACN), in 2024 about 18% of
cyberattacks targeted Public Administration, particularly affecting local authorities and healthcare
centers. This alarming trend prompted the government to respond with legislative measures and
security strategies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Social engineering - the Jedi mind trick of cyberattacks.</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/03/03/blog_soc_eng/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/03/03/blog_soc_eng/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>“These aren’t the droids you’re looking for”, “These aren’t the droids we’re looking for”&lt;/em> - The iconic exchange between Ben (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and the Stormtroopers in Star Wars episode IV - A New Hope.

&lt;p>Key findings of the report are outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>General increase&lt;/strong>: the report records in total 5.414 ransomware attacks in 2024, with an increase of 11% when compared to 2023.

Kaspersky’s GReAT (Global Research &amp;amp; Analysis Team) published a report that describes the recent ransomware attacks with the use of code.
The report sheds a light on the tools and the methods that are used by organized ransomware groups and single users. According to its findings the ransomware criminal organisations have a vast variety of tools and samples at their disposal. They often own sample ransomware, while isolated users often use DIY leaked variations to launch their attacks.
The study by Kasperksy reveals recent ransomware attacks, which take advantage of the source code leaks, by allowing the attackers to locate their victims and reproduce fast any malware activity, thus constituting them a significant threat.
Last April, the SEXi team attacked IxMetro, by using a recent ransomware variation called SEXi. This group targets ESXi apps while all the recognized victims used versions of the apps that were not supported.
SEXi uses different ransomware versions for every platform – Bakuk for Linus and Lockbit for Windows. They are, also, the only ones using this Session app for communication, with a unified ID for multiple attacks. This lack of professionalism and the absence of a TOR leak website made them stand out even more.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Dangerous malware in Greece</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/blog_dangerous_software/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/09/15/blog_dangerous_software/</guid><description>&lt;p>The last report from Check Point Research, in August 2024, reveals the most recent data on the most prevalent cyberthreats in a global scale but also in Greece. Qbot software was the main threat in Greece, affecting 12.77% of the organisations. FakeUpdates was second, which affected 10.21% of the Greek organisations, while Androgyh0st reached 3.62%. A number of other significant threats include Tofsee (3.19%), Njrat (2,34%), Joker (1,91%), SnakeKeylogger (1,70%) and AsyncRat, which recorded a percentage of 1,70% both in Greece and globally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Crowdstrike Falcon outage</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/07/24/blog_crowdstrike_falcon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/07/24/blog_crowdstrike_falcon/</guid><description>&lt;p>A faulty update was distributed to a cybersecurity software called The Falcon Sensor, provided by the company Crowdstrike. The botched update to the configuration files of the kernel-level vulnerability scanner caused an out-of-bounds memory read operation that resulted in affected machines booting over and over again. The fault was found and a fix was distributed within 12 hours, but damage had already been caused. Manually fixing the affected machines would take a lot longer. A total of over 8.5 million Windows systems had crashed, causing a multitude of different businesses to have their services to be hindered or even completely halted, including airlines, banks, different government agencies, railway traffic, and media companies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Information Society is leading the battle for Cybersecurity</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/18/blog_information_society/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/18/blog_information_society/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Ministry of Digital Governance (MDG) in Greece is implementing a set of projects through Information Society for the protection of public bodies against cyberattacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cybersecurity in the public sector is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring the integrity of essential services, and maintaining public trust. Government agencies handle vast amounts of personal data and critical infrastructure, making them prime targets for cyberattacks. Effective cybersecurity measures prevent data breaches, protect national security, and ensure the continuity of public services. By investing in robust cybersecurity frameworks, the public sector can mitigate risks, respond effectively to incidents, and uphold the privacy and safety of citizens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The importance of user role definition and access restrictions</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_importance_of_role_definition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 17:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_importance_of_role_definition/</guid><description>&lt;p>Many of us have seen the cinematic masterpiece called The Lord of the Rings and can recall the scene where Pippin Took touches The Palantír (the glass orb looking thing with the eye of Sauron in it) and thus gave said villain an insight to his mind.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bad news: Sauron knows everything Pippin knows.
The good news: Pippin doesn’t know anything!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At first there is the panic when Gandalf thinks Sauron now knows everything, then there is the calmness of realising the ‘fool of a Took&amp;rsquo; knows nothing that Sauron can use. If we compare that to real life: The panic of knowing your systems have been infiltrated, then the calmness of realising that the access is very limited and doesn’t cover any of the important parts of the IT system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New investigation by Kaspersky on Cyber Attacks</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_cyberattacks_kaspersky/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_cyberattacks_kaspersky/</guid><description>&lt;p>Kaspersky has recently concluded an &lt;a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_kaspersky-reports-attacks-on-industrial-sector-utilizing-cloud-infrastructure">investigation&lt;/a> into cyber-attacks targeting the industrial sector in Eastern Europe. The investigation has revealed the employment of advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by threat actors to compromise industrial organizations in the region. Industries such as manufacturing, industrial control system (ICS) engineering and integration have been particularly affected, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity preparedness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the research a series of targeted attacks was revealed, aiming at data -breach through the creation of a channel with similarities to cases previously reported, such as ExCone, and DexCone, a fact that clearly manifests the participation of APT31 (also known as Judgement Panda and Zirconium).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fileless present of Malware and its evolving ML based detection, classification and prevention</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/28/blog_innosec_fileless_present_of_malware/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/28/blog_innosec_fileless_present_of_malware/</guid><description>&lt;p>The main approach for detection and prevention of malware is based upon the concept of file signatures. More specifically, the AV solutions are scanning the system’s storage devices and hash files at process/creation time. Then they compare each of these hashes with their respective curated database which contains signatures of known malware samples. If there is a match then the file is flagged as malicious and subsequent actions take place to contain it. But what could happen if there was some kind of malware that did not rely on a file to accomplish its mission?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Risk of Misinformation and Disinformation in Cyber Threat Intelligence Communities</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/27/blog_innosec_misinformation_disinformation_in_cti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/27/blog_innosec_misinformation_disinformation_in_cti/</guid><description>&lt;p>The ever-growing digital landscape presents organisations with a double-edged sword: vast amounts of data on cyber threats and the challenge of sifting through it all. Here&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;strong>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)&lt;/strong> comes in. By analysing attacker behaviour and uncovering early signs of attacks, CTI empowers organisations to proactively defend themselves. However, a significant hurdle exists: &lt;strong>misinformation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This misinformation comes in two forms: &lt;strong>accidental mistakes&lt;/strong> (misinformation) and &lt;strong>deliberate deception&lt;/strong> (disinformation). Both pose serious threats to CTI&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness, eroding trust in shared intelligence and weakening cybersecurity defences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Local and Regional Authorities can improve their ransomware defenses</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/12/19/blog_regional_ransomware_defense/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/12/19/blog_regional_ransomware_defense/</guid><description>&lt;p>A recent study done by the National Association of State CIOs (NASCiO) and Deloitte found in the US 75% of state CISOs view ransomware as a threat. As this Govloop report reported “…there’s good reason for that. A number of factos, the report notes that combine to make local and regional governments particularly vulnerable to this attack”.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>High impact: Ransomeware is capable of causing an organization’s operations to a halt. As an attack it is one of the most likely facing local and regional organizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy entry: With commercialization of attacks using “Ransomware-as-a-Service”, even non-technical threat actors are able to profit easily from ransomware operations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emergence of distributors: Malware families tend to be, the Govloop article points out, prolific information stealers are linked to various ransomware operators.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If one had to answer this question, he would have to give many answers, depending on various factors. It is incredibly difficult for an organisation to fully comprehend the need and the importance of cybersecurity service or product when he hasn’t been exposed or harmed by a cyber-attack. It is even harder, when the organisation lacks the necessary funds, or has other priorities to address. In some cases, one needs to give specific examples of the danger and the prevention procedure or restoring. An issue that has arisen and has been widely discussed lately is a cyber-attack in the City Hall infrastructure of Thessaloniki, Greece. That has been a wake-up call for many Municipalities, but majorly the big ones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Cybersecurity Master's Program in Oulu</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/09/01/blog_new_cybersec_curri/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/09/01/blog_new_cybersec_curri/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cybersecurity is a new study option based on the research excellence in software security at the University of Oulu.

&lt;p>To appreciate the importance of the human element in cyber security, Haney suggests it would be best to understand the concepts of usability and usable cyber security.
The International Organization for Standardization definition of usability is ‘the extent to which people can use systems, products, and services with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction to accomplish their goals in a specified context of use’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why old school thinking?</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_why-old-school-thinking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_why-old-school-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;p>For many years, a report from Govloop in the US writes, government agencies have applied a “hodgepodge of cyber-security strategies” to counter both internal and external risks.

In particular, the bill aims at “ensuring the necessary balance between privacy protection and national security, within the constitutional frame and in the foundation of the best international policies.” Additionally, the bill strengthens the “citizen’s rights against the threats that are connected to the technological evolution”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bill in question deals with issues of counter surveillance with the use of right tools, the foundation of Information Academy and counterintelligence and the setting of a stricter privacy frame. A major part of the bill though is about cybersecurity and the enforcement of the privacy protection. A coordination committee is assembled with the task of breaking down of the related structures. A Unified Reporting Center for Cybersecurity is running in the ministry of Digital Governance. Also, for the first time, a National Plan for Valuation of Technology and Communication Systems hazard levels is structured. It is used for recognition, analysis and valuation of the hazards and their repercussions on the safety of the national technology, information and communication systems. Prior ambiguities in the embedding of this frame for privacy protection were lifted. The ministry of Justice embodies in this bill, a number of suggestions that were made during its consultation and further improvements were made.

&lt;p>As you may remember, one of the many exciting outcomes of CS-AWARE-NEXT is the collaboration platform that has been baptized CS-Connect in the Wien meeting!
CS-Connect is a collaboration layer for the ecosystem, aimed to support the organisations in their activities toward improved security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have collected the requirements and are now deciding what is the current basis for the development and overcoming different technological challenges. We have selected several Open Collaboration Platforms (CPs) to study and evaluate. The objective is to select the one that is best suitable for us to build CS-Connect on top, using the traditional and well-established open source development model of “Standing on the shoulder of giants” which is to guarantee quick prototyping, software stability and resiliency, as well as sustainability of complex software projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A step towards DORA Compliance</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/07/cs_aware_next_dora_compliance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/07/cs_aware_next_dora_compliance/</guid><description>&lt;p>Most organizations, regardless of the vertical, are often engaged in complex and massive interconnections leading to some security challenges. As a result, individual and local initiatives alone may not suffice to effectively defend against current and future threats. Indeed, more synergy and collaboration amongst companies that are “shareholders in security” hence affected by the breach from others, is essential. Recent EU cybersecurity initiatives including the NIS/NIS2 and DORA for the financial sector have ought to address the cybersecurity and resilience of both, organizations delivering essential and vital services on the one hand, and the financial services, on the other. According to both regulations, cyber risks from third party organizations and the ensuing disruption cannot be effectively managed without due attention to the supply chain risk management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The legend of The Scottish Thistle - the early version of a socio-technical defence system!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/24/cs_aware_next_scottish_thistle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/24/cs_aware_next_scottish_thistle/</guid><description>&lt;p>Technology is getting both advanced and effective, but what good does it do if we don’t understand and use it properly?

On a technical level there already is an elevated level of awareness and readiness. That is why in a first wave of attacks criminals usually focus on tricking users into opening up systems for them . While this has now been the rule for at least over a decade, the way in which these attacks are prepared now follow an almost military style approach. With new, highly distributed environments, little protected IoT systems, tools based on AI, and the weakest link in the chain, the human, not being able to invest the needed time and resources in cyber security, the rise in successful cyber-attacks is predictable . While the need for education and training is commonly accepted, the necessary significant shift in countering cyber-attacks from a purely operational to a tactical and strategic level is still an open issue in many organizations. Policy-based reactions to cyber-attacks should have long ago replaced the still prevailing bug-fixing approach to dealing with an intrusion. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Learning from military and business decision making, such long overdue model-based solutions are also finding their way into the field of cyber security. The first highly successful wave of these decision models is shaped by the now legendary OODA Loop , which properly links observations (e.g., OSINT cyber threat intelligence, system monitoring) with an advanced form of classification (called orientation). These two steps, when combined properly, can provide the critical situational awareness needed to make the right decision, on which the actions taken depend. Especially in distributed collaborative environments, which typically characterize the ecosystem of projects like CS-AWARE-NEXT , these models are a welcome game changer. When applied together with well-established cyber defence frameworks such as NIST/CSF , there is an opportunity to thwart even advanced AI-based attacks. Attacks are on the rise and their sophistication is growing, but better situational awareness, advanced military grade decision models and proven cybersecurity frameworks, when applied in an integrated way can equip Security Operations Centres with the necessary tools to successfully shelter the expected oncoming heavy attack storms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 questions – 3 answers: Starting up for 2023 with a discussion on ‘AI, the Universe and Everything’ with two Datrix C-level executives</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_3/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are happy to announce the third podcast with Pierluigi Vacca and Matteo Bregonzio of Datrix, Italy.&lt;/p>

Data poisoning attacks are one of the most insidious and difficult-to-detect kinds of threats on ML models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data poisoning is a type of adversarial attack in which a cybercriminal injects malicious data into a machine learning model.

As Miller [1], points out, local governments could benefit from the information that would lead to the early prevention of cyberattacks. Unfortunately, the information is often hidden or never revealed. Although municipalities are obliged to report attacks in a timely fashion, they often avoid reporting attacks to maintain credibility. Nor do they necessarily see sharing of information about attacks as useful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions II</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/11/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/11/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities2/</guid><description>&lt;p>Cyberattacks launched on municipal utility companies are similar to attacks in any other industry.

&lt;h4 id="denial-of-service">Denial of Service &lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Attacks that stop users from accessing essential networks are typically referred to as denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A DoS attack is initiated by a single attacking computer. A DDoS attack is launched by multiple attacking devices. While the attack is in progress, companies can&amp;rsquo;t access the means to provide services. These attacks have serious implications for any company, but the interruption of essential services like electricity or running water can quickly become disastrous.  Unfortunately, given the lack of training many utilities are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks. While these attacks are difficult to deal with, more work on raising an awareness of the issues and possible counter-measures would be invaluable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions I</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/02/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/02/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities1/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 2021 Jason Miller wrote an article on cybersecurity for municipal utilities stressing that cyber-attacks were increasing every year and greatly impacting a wide range of high-profile targets from governmental agencies to financial and insurance organizations, hospitals and other health facilities, and educational institutions. Of particular concern in many countries, he points out, is the situation on local levels where local governments with municipal utilities are often under-funded with poorly trained staff [1]. Unfortunately, the solutions he offers do not take into account the range of problems facing municipal utilities. Many are not aware, however, of how municipal utilities have become targets for “nation-state actors” and the possibly disastrous effects of an attack.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 questions – 3 answers Christmas 2022 edition: The second CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_2/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are happy to announce the second CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast with Juha Röning!&lt;/p>
