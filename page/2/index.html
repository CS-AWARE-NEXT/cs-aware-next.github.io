This includes a tighter integration between classical risk management and incident management tasks, in order to e.g. be able to more dynamically manage disaster recovery and business continuity after an incident. Collaboration within organizations (between different departments) and with other actors in the multi-level European cybersecurity framework, starting from actors in the local/regional supply chain to actors and authorities on the national/European level, is an important aspect to be addressed by a modern organizational cybersecurity management policy framework.</p></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-1 col-even"><div class=box-simple><div class=icon><i class="fas fa-users"></i></div><h3>Better cybersecurity cooperation and collaboration on the local and regional level</h3><div class=description><p>Provide a socio-technical framework for local/regional cooperation/collaboration on cybersecurity to better address local supply chain dependencies.

This objective aims to address this gap and provide adequate support for cooperation and collaboration on this level (both methodological and tool support), and to improve the link between the local/regional level and the multi-level cybersecurity framework outlined by European legislation.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="row row-1 row-even"><div class="col-md-6 col-0 col-odd"><div class=box-simple><div class=icon><i class="fas fa-user-friends"></i></div><h3>Improved data quality assessment and AI-based data correlation for utilising threat intelligence and social media in dynamic incident and risk management</h3><div class=description><p>Provide a real-time data collection and AI framework that is able to collect information from a variety of sources (log files, threat intelligence, social media, &mldr;) and correlate organizational and local/regional information (assets, dependencies, behaviour, &mldr;) with contextual cybersecurity information coming from threat intelligence or social media discussions. The goal of the framework is to be able to (a) better predict systemic vulnerabilities and risks by mapping the organizational state with the cybersecurity landscape in a dynamic way, and (b) derive mitigation and disaster recovery/business continuity/self-healing strategies, building the knowledge base for the dynamic cybersecurity and incident management covered in other project objectives (policy framework, local/regional and multi-level collaboration, dynamic business continuity and self-healing as well as cybersecurity information sharing).</p></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-1 col-even"><div class=box-simple><div class=icon><i class="fas fa-band-aid"></i></div><h3>Dynamic disaster recovery, business continuity and system self-healing on the organisational and local/regional level</h3><div class=description><p>Provide a framework for dynamic (real-time) creation and continuous reassessment of disaster recovery/business continuity options relevant to specific organizational or local/regional dependency set-ups to be able to deal with cascading effects. The framework will be designed to take into account systemic organizational and local/regional set-ups as well as general mitigation and recovery/ business continuity strategies shared via e.g. threat intelligence to predict and provide tailored recovery/ business continuity and self-healing strategies. The goal of this framework is the closer integration of disaster recovery/ business continuity, which is traditionally a risk management task, with the day-to-day (real-time) incident management. Therefore, the framework will provide integrations with cybersecurity incident management tools and advanced system self-healing tools for technical assistance and automated implementation of business continuity in case of an incident.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="row row-2 row-odd"><div class="col-md-6 col-0 col-odd"><div class=box-simple><div class=icon><i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i></div><h3>Improved integration of threat intelligence and information sharing in organisational cybersecurity management</h3><div class=description><p>The generation and sharing of threat intelligence based on real-world evidence is one of the core pillars of the multi-level collaborative European cybersecurity framework. Collaboration and information sharing is already operational to some extend on the European and national levels (e.g. between competent authorities, CSIRTs), but when it comes to utilization of threat intelligence by individual organizations and local/regional networks in their day-to-day cybersecurity incident and risk management, there is currently little awareness and supporting procedures/tools available to streamline the process.

In line with the framework defined by the 2013/2020 European cybersecurity strategy and subsequent legislation (e.g. NIS/NIS2), the aim is to continuously monitor and assess the cybersecurity state of organizations according to performance indicators related to the European cybersecurity framework (e.g. how much information shared, how many resources dedicated to collaboration in a certain time frame, impact on the effectiveness of cybersecurity management, &mldr;). This objective includes the definition of appropriate KPIs in the context of the main project objectives, and a reference implementation to automatically collect and visualize the relevant statistical information and to evaluate the KPIs in the context of the CS-AWARE platform. The goal of the KPI based benchmarking is to allow organizations to better assess their cybersecurity status against other relevant actors, and at the same time provide incentives to improve their behaviour in areas they are lacking behind, in order to more actively participate in the European collaborative cybersecurity efforts.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="row row-3 row-even"><div class="col-md-6 col-0 col-odd"><div class=box-simple><div class=icon><i class="fas fa-sitemap"></i></div><h3>Provide a reference implementation and deployment in the context of the CS-AWARE cybersecurity awareness and collaboration platform</h3><div class=description><p>While frameworks and methodologies defined through the project objectives are designed to be generic and can in general be adapted to any advanced cybersecurity solutions like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, a reference implementation of all frameworks and methodologies (policy framework, local/regional collaboration, AI framework, disaster recovery/business continuity framework, KPI based benchmarking and profiling framework, system self-healing and cybersecurity information sharing) will be provided in the context of the CS-AWARE platform developed during the CS-AWARE H2020 project, allowing to integrate the novel aspects developed in this project by extending existing components (awareness and visualization, data collection and AI, system self-healing, cybersecurity information sharing), and adding/integrating new components to the CS-AWARE framework (cybersecurity policy management, local/regional collaboration, business continuity, KPI based benchmarking and profiling).</p></div></div></div><div class="col-md-6 col-1 col-even"><div class=box-simple><div class=icon><i class="fas fa-code"></i></div><h3>Follow an agile, design-science based approach to project implementation and validation, with end-user involvement in all project phases</h3><div class=description><p>The applicability and relevance of the objectives addressed by this project in the context real-world scenarios needs to be ensured through agile, iterative and collaborative design, implementation and validation.

on June 27, 2025</p><p class=intro><p>As Greece continues to digitize its public and private sectors, cybersecurity has become a national priority. Recent high-profile cyberattacks on government services and critical infrastructure have underscored the country&rsquo;s vulnerability to emerging digital threats. With growing investment in AI, cloud technologies, and smart city initiatives, Greece faces the same global challenges—AI-enabled attacks, cloud misconfigurations etc—but often with fewer resources and cybersecurity professionals compared to larger nations. In this evolving threat landscape, staying ahead requires not only adopting global best practices but also preparing for the specific vulnerabilities that come with Greece’s digital transformation. Added to the aforementioned, is the challenge of the lack of digital literacy, which makes the progress in this field even slower.</p></p><p class=read-more><a href=https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2025/06/27/blog_check_point_software/ class="btn btn-template-main">Continue reading</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section class="bar background-white no-mb"><div class=container><div class=row><div class=col-md-12><div class="heading text-center"><h2>Project Partners</h2></div><p class=lead></p><ul class="owl-carousel customers" data-items=6 data-autoplay=true data-slide-speed=100 data-pagination-speed=1000><li class=item title="University of Oulu"><a href=https://www.oulu.fi/en target=_blank><img src=img/partners/unioulu.png alt="University of Oulu" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="CS-Aware Corporation OÜ"><a href=https://cs-aware.com/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/cs-aware-1.png alt="CS-Aware Corporation OÜ" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="University of Vienna"><a href=https://www.univie.ac.at/en/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/univie.png alt="University of Vienna" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Centro Regionale Information Communication Technology SCARL"><a href=http://www.cerict.it/en/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/unisa.png alt="Centro Regionale Information Communication Technology SCARL" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Politecnico di Milano"><a href=https://www.polimi.it/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/polimi.png alt="Politecnico di Milano" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Fujitsu Technology Solutions (Luxembourg) SA"><a href=https://www.fujitsu.com/lu/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/fujitsu.png alt="Fujitsu Technology Solutions (Luxembourg) SA" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Innovative Secure Technologies IKE"><a href=https://www.innosec.gr/en/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/innosec.jpg alt="Innovative Secure Technologies IKE" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Wise & Munro"><a href=http://www.wisemunro.eu/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/wiseandmunro.jpg alt="Wise & Munro" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title=3rdPlace><a href=https://3rdplace.com/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/3rdplace.png alt=3rdPlace class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title=RheaSoft><a href=https://rheasoft.dk/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/rheasoft.png alt=RheaSoft class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="CesViter Consulting SRL"><a href=https://www.cesviterconsulting.it/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/cesviter.png alt="CesViter Consulting SRL" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Open Technology Services AE"><a href="https://ots.gr/?lang=en" target=_blank><img src=img/partners/ots.png alt="Open Technology Services AE" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Focus Europe - Laboratorio Progettuale Per L'integrazione Europea Associazione"><a href="https://www.focuseurope.org/?lang=en" target=_blank><img src=img/partners/focuseurope.png alt="Focus Europe - Laboratorio Progettuale Per L'integrazione Europea Associazione" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Dimos Lariseon"><a href=https://www.larissa-dimos.gr/en/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/larissa.png alt="Dimos Lariseon" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Consorzio per l'Area di Sviluppo Industriale ASI di Foggia"><a href=https://www.asifoggia.it/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/asifoggia.jpg alt="Consorzio per l'Area di Sviluppo Industriale ASI di Foggia" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="ΔΗΜΟΤΙΚΗ ΕΠΙΧΕΙΡΗΣΗ ΥΔΡΕΥΣΗΣ ΚΑΙ ΑΠΟΧΕΤΕΥΣΗΣ ΛΑΡΙΣΑΣ - The Municipal Water and Sewerage Company of Larissa (DEYAL)"><a href=https://deyal.gr/en/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/deyal.png alt="ΔΗΜΟΤΙΚΗ ΕΠΙΧΕΙΡΗΣΗ ΥΔΡΕΥΣΗΣ ΚΑΙ ΑΠΟΧΕΤΕΥΣΗΣ ΛΑΡΙΣΑΣ - The Municipal Water and Sewerage Company of Larissa (DEYAL)" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="5 Ygionomiki Periferia Thessalias & Stereas Elladas"><a href=https://www.dypethessaly.gr/homepageen target=_blank><img src=img/partners/5dype.png alt="5 Ygionomiki Periferia Thessalias & Stereas Elladas" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Osterreichische Computer Gesellschaft"><a href=https://www.ocg.at/ target=_blank><img src=img/partners/OCG_Logo.png alt="Osterreichische Computer Gesellschaft" class=img-responsive></a></li><li class=item title="Barilla G.E.R.
