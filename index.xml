&lt;p>The last report from Check Point Research, in August 2024, reveals the most recent data on the most prevalent cyberthreats in a global scale but also in Greece. Qbot software was the main threat in Greece, affecting 12.77% of the organisations. FakeUpdates was second, which affected 10.21% of the Greek organisations, while Androgyh0st reached 3.62%. A number of other significant threats include Tofsee (3.19%), Njrat (2,34%), Joker (1,91%), SnakeKeylogger (1,70%) and AsyncRat, which recorded a percentage of 1,70% both in Greece and globally.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Crowdstrike Falcon outage</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/07/24/blog_crowdstrike_falcon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jul 2024 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/07/24/blog_crowdstrike_falcon/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-crowdstrike-falcon-outage">The Crowdstrike Falcon outage&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A faulty update was distributed to a cybersecurity software called The Falcon Sensor, provided by the company Crowdstrike. The botched update to the configuration files of the kernel-level vulnerability scanner caused an out-of-bounds memory read operation that resulted in affected machines booting over and over again. The fault was found and a fix was distributed within 12 hours, but damage had already been caused. Manually fixing the affected machines would take a lot longer. A total of over 8.5 million Windows systems had crashed, causing a multitude of different businesses to have their services to be hindered or even completely halted, including airlines, banks, different government agencies, railway traffic, and media companies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Information Society is leading the battle for Cybersecurity</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/18/blog_information_society/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2024 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/18/blog_information_society/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="information-society-is-leading-the-battle-for-cybersecurity">Information Society is leading the battle for Cybersecurity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Ministry of Digital Governance (MDG) in Greece is implementing a set of projects through Information Society for the protection of public bodies against cyberattacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cybersecurity in the public sector is crucial for safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring the integrity of essential services, and maintaining public trust. Government agencies handle vast amounts of personal data and critical infrastructure, making them prime targets for cyberattacks. Effective cybersecurity measures prevent data breaches, protect national security, and ensure the continuity of public services. By investing in robust cybersecurity frameworks, the public sector can mitigate risks, respond effectively to incidents, and uphold the privacy and safety of citizens.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The importance of user role definition and access restrictions</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_importance_of_role_definition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 17:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/06/11/blog_importance_of_role_definition/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-user-role-definition-and-access-restrictions">The importance of user role definition and access restrictions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many of us have seen the cinematic masterpiece called The Lord of the Rings and can recall the scene where Pippin Took touches The Palantír (the glass orb looking thing with the eye of Sauron in it) and thus gave said villain an insight to his mind.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Kaspersky has recently concluded an &lt;a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2023_kaspersky-reports-attacks-on-industrial-sector-utilizing-cloud-infrastructure">investigation&lt;/a> into cyber-attacks targeting the industrial sector in Eastern Europe. The investigation has revealed the employment of advanced tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) by threat actors to compromise industrial organizations in the region. Industries such as manufacturing, industrial control system (ICS) engineering and integration have been particularly affected, emphasizing the urgent need for enhanced cybersecurity preparedness.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>According to the research a series of targeted attacks was revealed, aiming at data -breach through the creation of a channel with similarities to cases previously reported, such as ExCone, and DexCone, a fact that clearly manifests the participation of APT31 (also known as Judgement Panda and Zirconium).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Fileless present of Malware and its evolving ML based detection, classification and prevention</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/28/blog_innosec_fileless_present_of_malware/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/28/blog_innosec_fileless_present_of_malware/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-fileless-present-of-malware-and-its-evolving-ml-based-detection-classification-and-prevention">The Fileless present of Malware and its evolving ML based detection, classification and prevention&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The main approach for detection and prevention of malware is based upon the concept of file signatures. More specifically, the AV solutions are scanning the system’s storage devices and hash files at process/creation time. Then they compare each of these hashes with their respective curated database which contains signatures of known malware samples. If there is a match then the file is flagged as malicious and subsequent actions take place to contain it. But what could happen if there was some kind of malware that did not rely on a file to accomplish its mission?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Risk of Misinformation and Disinformation in Cyber Threat Intelligence Communities</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/27/blog_innosec_misinformation_disinformation_in_cti/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2024/05/27/blog_innosec_misinformation_disinformation_in_cti/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-risk-of-misinformation-and-disinformation-in-cyber-threat-intelligence-communities">The Risk of Misinformation and Disinformation in Cyber Threat Intelligence Communities&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The ever-growing digital landscape presents organisations with a double-edged sword: vast amounts of data on cyber threats and the challenge of sifting through it all. Here&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;strong>Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)&lt;/strong> comes in. By analysing attacker behaviour and uncovering early signs of attacks, CTI empowers organisations to proactively defend themselves. However, a significant hurdle exists: &lt;strong>misinformation.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This misinformation comes in two forms: &lt;strong>accidental mistakes&lt;/strong> (misinformation) and &lt;strong>deliberate deception&lt;/strong> (disinformation). Both pose serious threats to CTI&amp;rsquo;s effectiveness, eroding trust in shared intelligence and weakening cybersecurity defences.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity and the Domino effect</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/12/20/cs_aware_next_dominos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Dec 2023 13:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/12/20/cs_aware_next_dominos/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cybersecurity--the-domino-effect">Cybersecurity &amp;amp; the Domino effect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A cyberattack is rarely caused by one big thing, but more often a combination of many little things. We see it all the time in disaster documentary film, how even the tiniest little detail can start a chain reaction with devastating results. A chain reaction that could have been stopped if even just one of the Dominos in the line were missing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take documentary film about plane crashes for example. We know flying is safe, we know how high the security priority is. In the events of a crash, we hear of all the frustratedly many small errors and we are left wondering how so many things have been overlooked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How Local and Regional Authorities can improve their ransomware defenses</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/12/19/blog_regional_ransomware_defense/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/12/19/blog_regional_ransomware_defense/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="how-local-and-regional-authorities-can-improve-their-ransomware-defenses">How Local and Regional Authorities can improve their ransomware defenses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A recent study done by the National Association of State CIOs (NASCiO) and Deloitte found in the US 75% of state CISOs view ransomware as a threat. As this Govloop report reported “…there’s good reason for that. A number of factos, the report notes that combine to make local and regional governments particularly vulnerable to this attack”.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>High impact: Ransomeware is capable of causing an organization’s operations to a halt. As an attack it is one of the most likely facing local and regional organizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Easy entry: With commercialization of attacks using “Ransomware-as-a-Service”, even non-technical threat actors are able to profit easily from ransomware operations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emergence of distributors: Malware families tend to be, the Govloop article points out, prolific information stealers are linked to various ransomware operators.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Clearly local and regional organizations need to revamp their strategies to deal with these challenges:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CriM 2023</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/10/11/blog_crim23/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Oct 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/10/11/blog_crim23/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="crim-2023">CriM 2023&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Just how hard is to describe the importance of a service whose value the customers cannot quite comprehend or quantify in order to invest in it in the Greek public sector?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If one had to answer this question, he would have to give many answers, depending on various factors. It is incredibly difficult for an organisation to fully comprehend the need and the importance of cybersecurity service or product when he hasn’t been exposed or harmed by a cyber-attack. It is even harder, when the organisation lacks the necessary funds, or has other priorities to address. In some cases, one needs to give specific examples of the danger and the prevention procedure or restoring. An issue that has arisen and has been widely discussed lately is a cyber-attack in the City Hall infrastructure of Thessaloniki, Greece. That has been a wake-up call for many Municipalities, but majorly the big ones.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Cybersecuirty Master's Program in Oulu</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/09/01/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_infrastructures/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Sep 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/09/01/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_infrastructures/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="new-cybersecuirty-masters-program-in-oulu">New Cybersecuirty Master&amp;rsquo;s Program in Oulu&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>As presented in the final expert report, ‘the whole HSBooster consultancy process with CS-AWARE NEXT went fluently and there was great support by the team of CS-AWARE NEXT to identify a suitable standardisation strategy for their envisioned project results’. It is also mentioned that ‘the CS-AWARE NEXT project is on a very good track’ and that we ‘have identified a clear and actionable target’ in terms of, amongst others, ‘adding an extension to the OASIS STIX public repository’. There is no doubt that this might potentially ‘pave the way for future standardisation impacts, i.e., the inclusion of the extension in the official STIX OASIS standard’.
Standardisation is, as known to all of us that have been involved in one or some other way in such a process, a long shot, but also well worth trying.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Enhancing your security with open-source tools</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/08/29/blog_enhancing_security_open_source/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Aug 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/08/29/blog_enhancing_security_open_source/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="enhancing-your-security-with-open-source-tools">Enhancing your security with open-source tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With cybersecurity gaining increased attention in Italy, it has emerged as the top priority for digital investment among businesses in 2023. Notably, both large enterprises and SMEs recognize the significance of robust cybersecurity measures. Recent data reveals that a staggering 61% of organisations with over 250 employees have chosen to boost their cybersecurity budgets in the past year. Moreover, the Italian cybersecurity market is projected to witness remarkable growth, reaching a value of 1.86 billion euros in 2022, reflecting an exceptional acceleration of +18% compared to the previous year. In this article, we delve into the realm of monitoring and analysis, exploring the potential of open-source solutions to strengthen cybersecurity defences and address the evolving challenges faced by Italian organisations.

&lt;p>About ten years ago the proposal of the original NIS-Directive was introduced into our lives. It was the first cybersecurity act in the EU, creating a new baseline for cybersecurity. Unfortunately the effects of the original NIS weren&amp;rsquo;t as good as initially hoped. Its objectives of increasing the level of security of network and information systems across the union were hindered by problems regarding different levels of resilience among member states, insufficient resilience of individual organisations, and ineffective oversight by government authorities. The decision was made to issue an updated act to take its place. In a little over 1,5 years, by October 18th 2024 to be precise, the successor will be incorporated into national law by each member state.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Data-driven cybersecurity</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/04/17/cs_aware_next_-blog_template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/04/17/cs_aware_next_-blog_template/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="data-driven-cybersecurity">Data-driven cybersecurity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The availability of a large amount of data facilitates the spreading of a data-driven culture in which data are used and analyzed to support decision-making. This is also true for the cybersecurity environment in which the increasing number of threats appearing over time and related public data caused a “paradigm shift in understanding and defending against the evolving cyber attacks, from primarily reactive detection toward proactive prediction”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conventional data analysis approaches cannot address the complexity of the new threats and the velocity with which they are generated and spread throughout the Internet: more flexible and efficient mechanisms are needed. Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems based on Machine Learning (ML) tools and exploiting the power provided by big data architectures seem promising solutions to detect and mitigate many of the novel cybersecurity attacks. They can analyze large volumes of data, identify anomalies and suspicious behavior and investigate threats by correlating many data points. Techniques such as regression, classification, and clustering are already used to identify network threats, detect software vulnerabilities, monitor email, and design advanced antivirus applications.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cyberattack in Thessaloniki</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_cyberattack_thessaloniki/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 13:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_cyberattack_thessaloniki/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cyberattack-in-thessaloniki">Cyberattack in Thessaloniki&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>This article from Julie Haney of NIST deals with some of the misconceptions and pitfalls that cyber security professionals fall victim to. These pitfalls reflect a tendency in the cyber security community “to focus and depend on technology to solve today’s security problems while at the same time failing to appreciate the human element: the individual and social factors affecting security adoption.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To appreciate the importance of the human element in cyber security, Haney suggests it would be best to understand the concepts of usability and usable cyber security.
The International Organization for Standardization definition of usability is ‘the extent to which people can use systems, products, and services with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction to accomplish their goals in a specified context of use’.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why old school thinking?</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_why-old-school-thinking/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/28/blog_why-old-school-thinking/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="why-old-school-thinking">Why old school thinking?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For many years, a report from Govloop in the US writes, government agencies have applied a “hodgepodge of cyber-security strategies” to counter both internal and external risks. Many relied on firewalls to manage external activity and potential threats. In the end, the Govloop authors conclude that Legacy firewalls tend to be more concerned with activity attempting to penetrate their perimeter defenses and do not monitor internal activities within the local network.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Greece's new Cybersecurity Bill</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/11/greece-new-cybersec-law/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/11/greece-new-cybersec-law/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="greeces-new-cybersecurity-bill">Greece&amp;rsquo;s new Cybersecurity Bill&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A bill on cyber security, telecommunication privacy issues and personal data has been submitted to the Greek parliament. In particular, the bill aims at “ensuring the necessary balance between privacy protection and national security, within the constitutional frame and in the foundation of the best international policies.” Additionally, the bill strengthens the “citizen’s rights against the threats that are connected to the technological evolution”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bill in question deals with issues of counter surveillance with the use of right tools, the foundation of Information Academy and counterintelligence and the setting of a stricter privacy frame. A major part of the bill though is about cybersecurity and the enforcement of the privacy protection. A coordination committee is assembled with the task of breaking down of the related structures. A Unified Reporting Center for Cybersecurity is running in the ministry of Digital Governance. Also, for the first time, a National Plan for Valuation of Technology and Communication Systems hazard levels is structured. It is used for recognition, analysis and valuation of the hazards and their repercussions on the safety of the national technology, information and communication systems. Prior ambiguities in the embedding of this frame for privacy protection were lifted. The ministry of Justice embodies in this bill, a number of suggestions that were made during its consultation and further improvements were made. A number of amendments were carried out and they are outlined below:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CS-Connect first steps!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/08/cs-connect-first-steps/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/08/cs-connect-first-steps/</guid><description>&lt;p>CS-Connect first steps!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you may remember, one of the many exciting outcomes of CS-AWARE-NEXT is the collaboration platform that has been baptized CS-Connect in the Wien meeting!
CS-Connect is a collaboration layer for the ecosystem, aimed to support the organisations in their activities toward improved security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have collected the requirements and are now deciding what is the current basis for the development and overcoming different technological challenges. We have selected several Open Collaboration Platforms (CPs) to study and evaluate. The objective is to select the one that is best suitable for us to build CS-Connect on top, using the traditional and well-established open source development model of “Standing on the shoulder of giants” which is to guarantee quick prototyping, software stability and resiliency, as well as sustainability of complex software projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A step towards DORA Compliance</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/07/cs_aware_next_dora_compliance/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Mar 2023 11:07:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/03/07/cs_aware_next_dora_compliance/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="a-step-towards-dora-compliance">A step towards DORA Compliance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most organizations, regardless of the vertical, are often engaged in complex and massive interconnections leading to some security challenges. As a result, individual and local initiatives alone may not suffice to effectively defend against current and future threats. Indeed, more synergy and collaboration amongst companies that are “shareholders in security” hence affected by the breach from others, is essential. Recent EU cybersecurity initiatives including the NIS/NIS2 and DORA for the financial sector have ought to address the cybersecurity and resilience of both, organizations delivering essential and vital services on the one hand, and the financial services, on the other. According to both regulations, cyber risks from third party organizations and the ensuing disruption cannot be effectively managed without due attention to the supply chain risk management.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The legend of The Scottish Thistle - the early version of a socio-technical defence system!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/24/cs_aware_next_scottish_thistle/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/24/cs_aware_next_scottish_thistle/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-legend-of-the-scottish-thistle---the-early-version-of-a-socio-technical-defence-system">The legend of The Scottish Thistle - the early version of a socio-technical defence system!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Technology is getting both advanced and effective, but what good does it do if we don’t understand and use it properly? Humans have a long history of using tools to help us make our jobs easier or for keeping us safe. However, technology can only do so much on it’s own.

&lt;p>Cyberthreats are continually becoming more sophisticated, thus creating a demand for an equally advanced threat detection and response. Detection of cyberthreats can very much benefit from the adoption of AI, as it is able to detect attack patterns and perform correlations among various security-related events. However, when it comes to incident handling, a fully AI-enabled approach may actually cause more harm than good, due to the critical human factors involved.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Storytelling Workshops 2022</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/20/cs_aware_next_2023_storytelling_ws/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/20/cs_aware_next_2023_storytelling_ws/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="storytelling-workshops-2022">Storytelling Workshops 2022&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>During the workshop, participants shared stories about their experiences with cybersecurity in their organisations, and, in addition, discussed real world examples of cyberattacks that had serious implications on a region, or, the term we like to use, on an entire ecosystem. An ecosystem is a group of organisations that live and interact together in a particular environment. Despite cybersecurity being ubiquitous, and attacks coming from anywhere, in an ecosystem, local organisations can have joint interests when it comes to cybersecurity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity – a case for advanced decision models</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/08/cs_aware_next_decision_models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/02/08/cs_aware_next_decision_models/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cybersecurity--a-case-for-advanced-decision-models">Cybersecurity – a case for advanced decision models&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Advanced attacks demand advanced countermeasures. On a technical level there already is an elevated level of awareness and readiness. That is why in a first wave of attacks criminals usually focus on tricking users into opening up systems for them . While this has now been the rule for at least over a decade, the way in which these attacks are prepared now follow an almost military style approach. With new, highly distributed environments, little protected IoT systems, tools based on AI, and the weakest link in the chain, the human, not being able to invest the needed time and resources in cyber security, the rise in successful cyber-attacks is predictable . While the need for education and training is commonly accepted, the necessary significant shift in countering cyber-attacks from a purely operational to a tactical and strategic level is still an open issue in many organizations. Policy-based reactions to cyber-attacks should have long ago replaced the still prevailing bug-fixing approach to dealing with an intrusion. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel. Learning from military and business decision making, such long overdue model-based solutions are also finding their way into the field of cyber security. The first highly successful wave of these decision models is shaped by the now legendary OODA Loop , which properly links observations (e.g., OSINT cyber threat intelligence, system monitoring) with an advanced form of classification (called orientation). These two steps, when combined properly, can provide the critical situational awareness needed to make the right decision, on which the actions taken depend. Especially in distributed collaborative environments, which typically characterize the ecosystem of projects like CS-AWARE-NEXT , these models are a welcome game changer. When applied together with well-established cyber defence frameworks such as NIST/CSF , there is an opportunity to thwart even advanced AI-based attacks. Attacks are on the rise and their sophistication is growing, but better situational awareness, advanced military grade decision models and proven cybersecurity frameworks, when applied in an integrated way can equip Security Operations Centres with the necessary tools to successfully shelter the expected oncoming heavy attack storms.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 questions – 3 answers: Starting up for 2023 with a discussion on ‘AI, the Universe and Everything’ with two Datrix C-level executives</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_3/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_3/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="3-questions--3-answers-starting-up-for-2023-with-a-discussion-on-ai-the-universe-and-everything-with-two-datrix-c-level-executives">3 questions – 3 answers: Starting up for 2023 with a discussion on ‘AI, the Universe and Everything’ with two Datrix C-level executives&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>Data poisoning is an increasingly important security concern for Machine Learning (ML) systems.

Data poisoning attacks are one of the most insidious and difficult-to-detect kinds of threats on ML models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Data poisoning is a type of adversarial attack in which a cybercriminal injects malicious data into a machine learning model. These attacks can be used to manipulate the results of a machine learning system, or to redirect the system&amp;rsquo;s resources away from its intended purpose.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Massive increase in cyber attacks in 2022</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/24/cs_aware_next_massive-cyber/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/24/cs_aware_next_massive-cyber/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="massive-increase-in-cyber-attacks-in-2022">Massive increase in cyber attacks in 2022&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>Failing to understand the gravity of the potential effects of a power grid attack leaves municipal utility companies unprepared to enact the necessary cybersecurity counter-measures necessary to prevent or, at least, mitigate attacks. As Miller [1], points out, local governments could benefit from the information that would lead to the early prevention of cyberattacks. Unfortunately, the information is often hidden or never revealed. Although municipalities are obliged to report attacks in a timely fashion, they often avoid reporting attacks to maintain credibility. Nor do they necessarily see sharing of information about attacks as useful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions II</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/11/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/11/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities2/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cybersecurity-for-public-utilities-solutions-ii">Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions II&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cyberattacks launched on municipal utility companies are similar to attacks in any other industry. However, the potential for OT attacks and the dangers of a major service disruption has raised the stakes. Miller outlines in this article [1] the most common cybersecurity attacks that have affected municipal utility companies. &lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="denial-of-service">Denial of Service &lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Attacks that stop users from accessing essential networks are typically referred to as denial of service (DoS) or distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. A DoS attack is initiated by a single attacking computer. A DDoS attack is launched by multiple attacking devices. While the attack is in progress, companies can&amp;rsquo;t access the means to provide services. These attacks have serious implications for any company, but the interruption of essential services like electricity or running water can quickly become disastrous.  Unfortunately, given the lack of training many utilities are particularly vulnerable to denial of service attacks. While these attacks are difficult to deal with, more work on raising an awareness of the issues and possible counter-measures would be invaluable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions I</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/02/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jan 2023 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2023/01/02/cs_aware_next_cybersecurity_for_public_utilities1/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="cybersecurity-for-public-utilities-solutions-i">Cybersecurity For Public Utilities Solutions I&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In 2021 Jason Miller wrote an article on cybersecurity for municipal utilities stressing that cyber-attacks were increasing every year and greatly impacting a wide range of high-profile targets from governmental agencies to financial and insurance organizations, hospitals and other health facilities, and educational institutions. Of particular concern in many countries, he points out, is the situation on local levels where local governments with municipal utilities are often under-funded with poorly trained staff [1]. Unfortunately, the solutions he offers do not take into account the range of problems facing municipal utilities. Many are not aware, however, of how municipal utilities have become targets for “nation-state actors” and the possibly disastrous effects of an attack.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3 questions – 3 answers Christmas 2022 edition: The second CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/podcasts/podcast_2/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="3-questions--3-answers-christmas-2022-edition-the-second-cs-aware-next-podcast">3 questions – 3 answers Christmas 2022 edition: The second CS-AWARE-NEXT Podcast&lt;/h3>

However, there are many generic cybersecurity issues that the report raises that are to be addressed in the CS-AWARE-NEXT project&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The hard thing about impact</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/13/cs_aware_next_the_hard_thing_about_impact/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/13/cs_aware_next_the_hard_thing_about_impact/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-hard-thing-about-impact">The hard thing about impact&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It is now over 8 years that the ‘Hard Thing about Hard Things’ has become a best-selling reader on entrepreneurship. The reason that the audience liked the book may be because the author is not afraid to take for granted that mistakes happen and are an inevitable, or as I prefer to call: a ‘shadow capital’ for every enterprise and venture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ben Horowitz, the author of the books, is apart from businessman and investor also active as blogger, devoting time and energy to communicate his ideas and also have them tested with a wider audience.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The world is changing…</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/05/cs_aware_next_the_world_is_changing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/05/cs_aware_next_the_world_is_changing/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-world-is-changing">The world is changing…&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>… and startups are considered as &lt;strong>agents of change.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Young people now, as well as less young ones, quit their jobs ‘en masse’ and find substance and what each of us may understand in our own, individual ways as ‘meaning in life’ – this is what became to get known as the Great Resignation or the Big Quit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many of us have been praised within conservative education and life cultures, feeling that taking risks is worth once you have a big organisation to support you. Many of us think like this, and many of us act like this – this is what finally contributes to make change not easy to accept and promote a culture that does the opposite: hinder change.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Another attack…</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/01/cs_aware_next_another_attack/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Sep 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/09/01/cs_aware_next_another_attack/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="another-attack">Another attack…&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Last week, another attack against the UK&amp;rsquo;s National Health Service: this time the target was the NHS 111, a hot line helps people get the right advice and treatment when they urgently need it. So it is not about cinema ticket reservations or something else that one would consider as less important, less critical or less urgent.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>A new Horizon Europe research project to help organisations and local &amp;amp; regional networks improve cybersecurity awareness and collaboration.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A pan-European consortium led by the University of Oulu in Finland has successfully launched a new Horizon Europe project. The project is called CS-AWARE-NEXT and builds on the legacy of the CS-AWARE project, that was part of the Horizon 2020 Programme, a predecessor of Horizon Europe.
The project application has been been successfully evaluated for all three dimensions related to scientific excellence, societal and economic impact and the quality of the research plan implementation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello world!</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/04/28/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 12:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/blog/2022/04/28/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hello-world">Hello world!&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Description:&lt;/strong> Provide a cybersecurity management policy framework for organizations to better address the dynamic and constantly changing cybersecurity landscape. This includes a tighter integration between classical risk management and incident management tasks, in order to e.g. be able to more dynamically manage disaster recovery and business continuity after an incident. Collaboration within the organization (between different departments) and with other actors in the multi-level European cybersecurity framework, starting from actors in the local/regional supply chain to actors and authorities on the national/European level, is an important aspect to be addressed by a modern organizational cybersecurity management policy framework.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Project</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/project_overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/project_overview/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="overviewa-nameoverviewa">Overview&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The mission of CS-AWARE-NEXT is to address cybersecurity and collaboration within local/regional (intra-organisational and supply chain) networks, in concert with the multi-level European cybersecurity framework as defined by the European cybersecurity strategy. This is achieved through the integration of new methods and tools for provisioning of improved disaster preparedness, multi-level information sharing and advanced AI-based self-healing, to aid in recovery and business continuity of inter-dependent NIS sector organizations in an effort to better address cascading cybersecurity issues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Publications</title><link>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/project_publications/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://cs-aware-next.github.io/project_publications/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="reports-and-deliverables">Reports and Deliverables&lt;/h1>
