&lt;p&gt;As you may remember, one of the many exciting outcomes of CS-AWARE-NEXT is the collaboration platform that has been baptized CS-Connect in the Wien meeting!
CS-Connect is a collaboration layer for the ecosystem, aimed to support the organisations in their activities toward improved security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have collected the requirements and are now deciding what is the current basis for the development and overcoming different technological challenges. We have selected several Open Collaboration Platforms (CPs) to study and evaluate. The objective is to select the one that is best suitable for us to build CS-Connect on top, using the traditional and well-established open source development model of “Standing on the shoulder of giants” which is to guarantee quick prototyping, software stability and resiliency, as well as sustainability of complex software projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
