interconnected, collaboration between organisations and regions is essential.
That’s where CS-CONNECT comes in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Developed as part of the CS-AWARE NEXT project and funded by the European
Union’s Horizon Europe programme, CS-CONNECT is an innovative platform. Its
main goal is to support local and regional cybersecurity collaboration by offering a
dynamic environment in which organisations can share and review information, co-
create security policies and respond quickly to cybersecurity incidents.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
